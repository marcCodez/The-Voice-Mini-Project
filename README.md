An application where I wanted to solidify my vanilla JavaScript knowledge without the aid of a tutorial. I'm a big fan of the voice TV show which I drew inspiration from in creating this project. Basically you can act as the producer by adding your desired contestants to the blind auditions which will be stored in local storage, ot you can act as the judge by iterating through each contestant and pressing turn to reveal the mystery singer if you are fond of the performance or next if you dislike it.
